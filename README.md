# About me

- ðŸŽ“ I'm Luis Postigo, a **Software Developer & Aerospace Engineer** (Specializing in Machine Learning and computational methods)! Currently pursuing my bachelors in **Software Engineering** after completing my degree in **Aerospace Engineering**.
- ðŸ’» I enjoy contributing to different projects, proposing solutions and making everything a learning experience. I mainly focus on PyTorch and TensorFlow, but also enjoy using other non ML methods to develop systems that I find interesting!
